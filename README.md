# Angular for Beasts

A simple Angular project used for some lessons for infoFactory Srl about:

- Consuming APIs with a declarative approach and async pipe
- Hot & cold observables
- RxJS operators
- Subjects
- Angular routers less known features (canDeactivate/canLoad guards, resolvers, tracing...)
- Internationalisation with ngx-translate
- Optimizations (pipes over functions, attributes over inputs, preloading strategies, detection strategies)
- Working of HttpClient/HttpBackend and uses of http interceptors (caching, auth & more)
- Component comunications via an event bus (Mediator pattern)

> INFO: Not all of this arguments are in this repo.
